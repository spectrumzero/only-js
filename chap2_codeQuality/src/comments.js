/*  NOTE:
 *  1. If the code is so unclear that it requires a comment, then maybe it should be rewritten instead.
 *  2. Sometimes it is benifical to replace a code piece with a function, or to create functions to replace comments.
 *     Functions themselves tell what is going on so there is nothing to comment.
 *  3. Explanatory comments are usually bad, but we still need them to provide more complex information sometimes.
 *  4. Comments that provide high-level overview of components, how they interact, what is the control flow in various situations are acceptable.
 *     Comments that document function parameters and usage are also acceptable. (Recommended: JSDOC for JavaScript, Doxygen for Cpp)
 *     Comments that explain why is the task solved exactly this way rather than that way are also important.
 *     If the code has anything subtle and counter-intuitive, it is definitely worth commenting.
 *     AVOID commenting solely to explain how the code works and what it does. This information should be clear from the code or function itself.
